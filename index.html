              In 2013, a search for meaning incited a cosmic series of events
              that brought me all around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              My job was to provide grants and project management support where
              humanitarian crises struck. It was an incredible opportunity that
              taught me professionally how to quickly learn about a situation,
              prioritize the tasks to be done, and follow through; personally,
              it gave me a profound new perspective on life.

            Between every job I had in this five year period, I mulled over
            three choices: take another job, take a vacation, or go back to
            school. The thrill of travel and gainful employment often beat out
            my interests in higher education, but eventually living out of a
            suitcase lost some appeal and I felt it was time to plant some
            roots, and try something new.
          </p>
          <p>
            This curiosity led me to learn more about what laid at the nexus of
            business, technology, and psychology at
            <a href="https://www.hmkw.de/" target="_blank">
              the HMKW University of Applied Sciences for Media, Communication
              and Management</a
            >. There, in pursuing a masters in Business Psychology, I developed
            a deep interest in the forecasted effects of automation on business
            and society. Moreover, these studies allowed me to explore facits of
            software development, and helped me forge my path to product
            management.

                        This thesis research concerns the perceptions of a
                        prospective social networking application. To measure

                        utilized and analyzed for ten social networking

                        rejected through this research, it validated my desire
                        to work in product, and it ultimately was an valuable
                        experience that prepared me for a successful career as a

              I had hoped that my master studies would bring me closer to
              technology which could be harnessed to unleash humanity, in some
              way. Moreover, I hoped that I would be able to feel a sense of
              thriving in my new career. And after five years of work experience
              in B2B and B2C start up and scale up software companies, I am
              happy to report that my hopes were well placed.

            <p>
              It turns out, there are private companies with humanitarian
              missions, and I am truly in a state of flow when I work for them.
              As a Product Manager, I feel that I have both the creativity to
              conjure big ideas, and the logical reasoning as well as hard
              skills to test the validity of those ideas. I reckon that a
              healthy dose of skepticism helps me to think critically and plan
              well, given my record for punctually delivering complex
              initiatives. However I believe that I am particularly skilled at
              empathizing with users, managing stakeholders, and instilling a
              high team morale.

              Though I owe a lot to my previous experiences, I made this website
              for the experiences yet to come: entering a role which complements
              my strengths that also inspires me to learn; in a field where
              compassion, collaboration, and human ingenuity are deployed as
              means to foster health and happiness.
